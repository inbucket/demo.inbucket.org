<h2>Welcome to the Inbucket demonstration instance</h2>

<p><em>tl;dr</em> - click <code>Monitor</code> above to get started.</p>

<p>Inbucket is an email testing service; it will accept email for any email
address and make it available to view without a password.</p>

<p>This instance is running on Google Compute Engine, and utilizes
<a href="https://github.com/jhillyerd/fauxmailer">fauxmailer</a> to generate
a stream of fake email. Feel free to poke around, delete mails, or try out
the REST API.</p>

<p>To protect our visitors, this instance does not accept external mail.  You
will need to install your own copy of Inbucket to use it in your
environment.</p>
